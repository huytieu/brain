Fantom is a platform that uses distributed ledger technology. The purpose of the dev team when building Fantom is to create a new generation platform based on Directed Acrylic Graph (DAG) technology. It allows the construction of dApps that improve the network scaling problems faced by current Blockchain platforms. In essence, Fantom uses a DAG structure (not a Blockchain), but the same distributed ledger.
