The Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is a blockchain that runs parallel to the Binance Chain. Unlike the Biance Chain, BSC boasts smart contract functionality and compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The goal of the BSC design is to keep the high throughput of the Binance Chain intact while also being able to bring smart contracts into the ecosystem of the Binance Chain.
