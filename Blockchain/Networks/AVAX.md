Avalanche (AVAX) is an open source, smart contract platform that enables the deployment of highly decentralized applications, financial products, digital assets, and interoperable blockchains.

Currently, the financial market is still fragmented due to regulations and geographical distance, a large amount of asset value is not accessible to the needs of users globally. Therefore, Avalanche allows financial networks to connect to a common platform that makes launching and trading digital assets easy. This is possible because Avalanche creates a platform of platforms where thousands of different sub-networks depending on the user's purpose, those sub-networks can connect to create a global market network.
